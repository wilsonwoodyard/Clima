# Clima

This app was made as apart of a Udemy iOS Development Bootcamp. I was provided the starting UI as well as the image assets. 

I was able to connect to an API from Open Weather, parse the JSON data within my project, then return that information and display it on the UI. I tapped into Apple's SF symbols to display a graphic of the current weather conditions. I also utilized CoreLocation to obtain the users' location as an alternate means for retreiving weather data.
In addition to the backend fuctionality, I adapted the UI to be responsive to light and dark mode.
